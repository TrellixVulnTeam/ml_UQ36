Model Architecture:
===================
Diverse Ensembling: Select diverse models, prune similar models
10-Crop Inference: Split the image into 9 pieces
Mask R-CNN with ResNeXt/ResNet-101/50-FPN = RoIAlign + Multitask Training + ResNeXt/ResNet-101/50

Data Architecture:
==================
Balanced datasets: images must be represented equally in number
